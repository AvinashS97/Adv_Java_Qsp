		// Collection Framework
Collection Framework is a group of many interface and classes which works together to store a group of elements and perform CRUD operation efficiently.
Collection Framework is available in java.util package we have to import java.util.*; package to use the collection framework interfaces and classes.

		Difference between Array and Collection Framework:- 
Array:- In array we can store only similar type of elements.
		Array is fixed in size.
		Array is not good in memory management.
		Array does not have any inbuilt methods so code complexity increases in array.
		In array we can store primitive or Non-Primitive data.
		Array provides faster performance.

Collection:- In Collection Framework we can store heterogeneous type of elements.
			 Collection Framework is dynamic which can grow or shrink as per requirement.
			 Collection framework is best for memory management.
			 In Collection Framework it provides large amount of inbuilt features by which code become simple and more readable.
			 In Collection Framework only Non-Primitive data or object type is allowed to store.
			 Collection Framework is slower in performance than Array.
